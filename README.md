# Employment-Application
A complete interactive employment application using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and jQuery UI.  This 
application is intended to illustrate a use of Javascript tools.  It is not intended to
represent a completed employment application.  It is not connected to a database but
could easily be connected to any SQL or MongoDB resource. 

This project has been committed to GitHub and made available under public license. 
It is intended to be used as an illustration of Javascript and jQuery tools.

It is not intended to represent a completed application - primarily because a database component
would be needed to save and transmit application information.

Note: Public license does not mean this project can or should be used for academic purposes. 
Students utilizing the code in this project should carefully consult the guidelines of their 
academic institution.
