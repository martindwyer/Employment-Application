# Employment-Application

A complete interactive employment application using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and jQuery UI.

This application is intended to illustrate a use of Javascript tools. It is not intended to
represent a completed employment application.

This project has been committed to GitHub and made available under public license.
It is intended to be used as an illustration of Javascript and jQuery tools.

It is not intended to represent a completed application - primarily because a database component
would be needed to save and transmit application information.

The first version of this application was published in 2017 and is included in the releases as v1.0.0 of the repository.

The present version, v2.0.0 is in the process of being completed. In addition to jQueary UI and Validation, v2.0.0 is built with the Bootstrap grid structure.

Modifications in process for v2.0.0 are designed to improve interaction on mobile devices.
